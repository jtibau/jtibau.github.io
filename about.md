I was born in Guayaquil, a large city on the coast of Ecuador. I love to travel and have had the pleasure to experience living in Barcelona, Spain as well as Little Rock, Arkansas. My current place of residence is Blacksburg, Virginia where I am a Ph.D. Student in the <a href='http://www.cs.vt.edu/'>Computer Science</a> program at <a href='http://www.vt.edu'>Virginia Tech</a>.

My research interests are in HCI, specially in Virtual Reality. As new technologies are bringing this field to the masses I believe it is one of the most exciting areas of study at the moment.

You can follow my blog [here](/). Although content is scant at the moment, I will try to keep it up-to-date with my research, school projects and interesting assignments.

Education
=========

- Ph.D. Computer Science, currently enrolled. [Virginia Tech](http://www.vt.edu/), USA.
- M.Sc. Computer Science, 2010. [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](http://www.upc.edu/), Spain.
- B.Sc. Computer Science, 2009. [Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral](http://www.espol.edu.ec/), Ecuador.

Research
========

My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction, Virtual Reality, Cognitive Psychology and CS Education. More speciffically, my research focus is on understanding naturalness and  affordances to improve the design of interaction techniques in virtual environments.

I am currently looking for an advisor at VT. I have been attending various research group meetings as well as used this opportunity to have interesting conversations with the faculty here. As I am interested in HCI, the breath of opportunities offered by VT is stunning to me. I hope to update this section soon as I get more involved in the research being done by some of my professors and peers.

Awards
======

- [Fulbright](http://www.fulbright.org/) Scholarship, 2014.
- [SENESCYT](http://www.senescyt.gob.ec/) Scholarhip, 2009-2010.

Teaching Experience
===================

From 2011 to 2014 I was a full-time Assistant Professor at [ESPOL](http://www.espol.edu.ec/). During this period I taught the following courses in our undergraduate program:

- *Programming Fundamentals*. A beginners introduction to programming, directed for the EECS department and using Scilab and C as its programming languages.
- *Data Structures*. A data structures design and applications course taught in C.
- *Object-Oriented Programming*. A hands-on introduction to OOP using Java.
- *Computer Architecture and Organization*. An introduction to these concepts, focused on understanding the lower layer of a computers processes. Students did a small project using MIPS.
- *Programming Languages*. An introduction to the concepts of programming languages. Heavy emphasis was placed on the design decisions of a language and how they affect its characteristics. Four projects were developed throughout the semester so students could experience using different paradigms and tools.
- *Virtual Reality*. A special topics class. The students were able to build an immersive experience using optical tracking systems, stereopgrahic glasses and large displays. The focus was on understanding the extent of the area and some of its current research problems.

At ESPOL, I also worked in the [Center for Information Technologies](http://www.cti.espol.edu.ec/). The main outcome of my work there was the purchase, configuration and development of applications for their new VR and Visualization Lab.
