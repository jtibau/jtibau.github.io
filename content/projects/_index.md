A few representative projects that show how I build user-centered systems end-to-end.

## FamilySong (HCI + Full-stack + Hardware)
**Goal:** Support connection and shared culture in internationally distributed families through music.  
**What I built:** Multi-location synchronized listening devices with an NFC-based interface, backed by a multi-user system.  
**How it shipped:** Iterative prototyping and in-home deployments with families, refining both the technical system and the experience.

**Skills shown:** product thinking, prototyping, full-stack implementation, user research, iteration.

## Prototyping & Interactive Systems (Selected work)
I’ve built and evaluated a range of interactive prototypes that combine software, devices, and real-world constraints, including:
- Custom embedded interfaces and IoT-style prototypes
- Full-stack web components used to coordinate multi-user experiences
- Rapid iteration using 3D printing, electronics, and woodworking

## Collaboration & Teaching-Driven Engineering (Selected work)
A large part of my career has involved turning ambiguous requirements into working systems with small teams:
- Scoping projects, defining success metrics, and guiding implementation
- Mentoring developers and coordinating delivery in interdisciplinary groups
- Communicating technical tradeoffs to non-technical stakeholders
