I was born in Guayaquil, a large city on the coast of Ecuador. I love to travel and have had the pleasure to experience living in Barcelona, Spain as well as Little Rock, Arkansas. My current place of residence is Blacksburg, Virginia where I am a Ph.D. Student in the Computer Science program at <a href='http://www.vt.edu'>Virginia Tech</a>.

I enjoy doing sports. You can ask me to play tennis, basketball, football (soccer) and am also enthusiastic about cycling. Being from a tropical country I am very excited about skiing near VT. My main pastime is playing with my wife and daughter.
